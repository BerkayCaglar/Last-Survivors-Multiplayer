# Last-Survivors-Multiplayer
 
This game is in the top down type.
The aim of the game is to survive the zombie attacks with your friends.

It has a structure that can be played by up to 4 people. There are 2 types of active weapons that anyone can use.

The map is prepared as a semi-open world. As map contents; There are abandoned gas station, abandoned hut and highway. The remaining spots are forested areas.

The weapons of the characters of the players have a light and they can see their surroundings thanks to this light. Therefore, you should always be on the alert to prevent a zombie attack from behind.

There is a minimap system in the game. You can see the surrounding interactions, players, NPCs and quests.

With the UI system, you can see which weapon you are on, how much life you have left, what your stamina is in, etc.

The game is still under development.

I am currently dealing with the Client Reconciliation system.
